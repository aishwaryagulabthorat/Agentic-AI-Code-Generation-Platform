# Agentic AI Code Generation Platform

An end-to-end **Agentic AI system** that transforms a high-level developer prompt into **production-ready full-stack code** using multiple AI agents, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and an iterative feedback loop.

---

## What This Project Does

This system allows a user to:

- Describe **what they want to build** in natural language
- Select **frontend and backend frameworks**
- Automatically:
  - Parse intent
  - Retrieve relevant APIs via semantic search
  - Plan integrations
  - Generate full-stack code
- Review generated code
- Provide feedback
- Regenerate code iteratively
- Download the final codebase as a ZIP

All powered by an **agent-orchestrated AI pipeline**.
